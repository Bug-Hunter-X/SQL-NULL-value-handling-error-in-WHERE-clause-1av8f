In SQL, a common yet often subtle error involves incorrect handling of NULL values.  Consider a query with a WHERE clause comparing a column to a specific value, for example:  `SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id = 10;`  If `department_id` can contain NULL values, rows where `department_id` is NULL will be excluded, even if you intend to include them. This is because NULL is not equal to anything, not even itself.  Similar issues arise in joins and aggregate functions.  Incorrect assumptions about NULL behavior can lead to unexpected query results.
